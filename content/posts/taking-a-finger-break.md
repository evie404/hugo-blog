I promised to write daily, but really can't today due to persistent thumb pain from excessive Overwatch practice in an impromptu coaching session. It's funny because I actually started writing today's post about an existential anxiety expressed through the lens of the game, but now I can't because I played it too much.

I've ordered compression gloves and braces in hopes of alleviating the pain. Might also look into alternative game settings and ergonomic keyboards. Tips are welcome. Thanks for reading despite the lack of substantial content.
