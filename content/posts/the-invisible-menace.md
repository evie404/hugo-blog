It might seem hard to understate the economic effects of the current pandemic, but I worry that the lack of caution is exactly what's happening. In just the past few months, we witnessed numerous worrying signs that defied all historical trends, whether it is the speed of the stock market drop, the negative oil price, or the levels of death and unemployment around the world. All this has been magnified by the negligence of the current administration, with little signs of any interest in actually tackling the problem. That that is only what we've seen. I worry that we are heading into a global macroeconomic crisis that one could describe as the perfect storm with the United States in the center that has been long overdue, and more severely fueled by the ongoing pandemic. While it may be tempting to describe the coming storm as unprecedented, the reality is this happened almost a century ago with the Great Depression. Call it the Great Coronavirus Depression if you must. In the next few posts, I will lay out short and near term trends, how they compare to past depressions, and more importantly, why I believe it is likely to be of similar magnitude as the Great Depression.

Longest time without recession

Ever since the Great Depression, the United States has consistently faced a recession every one to ten years. While recessions have become much less frequently in the past decades, the current time period up until March would have been the longest streak of growth, ever. We could either interpret this record as recessions are a thing of the past thanks to recent advancements in monetary policy, or that one is just around the corner. While the officials of the current administration might disagree, I'd say the recession was coming even without the pandemic.

It is important to examine the semantics of the past decade of growth. While the economy has been growing tremendously on paper, there is little to celebrate for the common person with years of stagnant wage growth and rising living costs. The only real growth seems to be in inequality with wealth further concentrated into the hands of the rich. This is because this growth has been largely fueled by stimulus designed to benefit the wealthy. Other than the symbolic Trump checks that can't even afford a month's rent in many cities, all of the stimulus like tax cuts or bailouts have benefitted largely corporations and their already-wealthy shareholders.
